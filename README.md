# hobbes

Hobbes is inspired by [ClaudePlaysPokemon](https://twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon). Can we get other models, and ideally open ones, to also play Pokemon? Surely they have seen enough of the internet to know that you never use Leer and just spam Tackle?

## Setup

We use [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) to manage dependencies, and `uv` to manage the Python project. After cloning and setting up Hermit, run `uv venv` to create a new environment, source the venv, and you should be good.

```bash
python main.py
```
