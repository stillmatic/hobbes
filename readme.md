Let's make Claude Plays Pokemon, but with any model.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Hook up bot framework to PyBoy
- [ ] Hook up LLMs / open router / something? 
- [ ] Implement agent (aka for loop)
- [X] Display the game

## Notes

- Pokemon Blue, because Deepseek is blue.
- Chain sequential inputs
- Agents: what should we allow?
    - Long term memory
    - Short term memory
